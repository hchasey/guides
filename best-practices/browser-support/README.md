# Browser Support

While this page is titled _Browsers Support_, we'll first take a couple steps back and then get to an actual list of some browsers.

## Web Standards

First and before thinking about supporting any specific browsers, please develop our browser-processed code according to established standards. As of 2015, the [W3C](http://www.w3.org) shepherds the most widely used and agreed upon [standards](http://www.w3.org/standards/) for the [web](http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/). Following these standards facilitates broad browser support and positions our application well for the future. Plus, it they might just [save us from zombies](https://vimeo.com/110256895).

Related standards specifications:

- [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/)
- [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
- [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

## Progressive Enhancement

Following standards compliance, use progressive enhancement.

## Browser Support

Since browsers do not perfectly implement or agree on standards and we have to write and test software today for actual users using web browsers, there comes a point to define a list of the most used browsers on on desiringGod.org. Below is a list of the most used (greater than 1 percent of traffic over 3 months) browsers and versions as of _Augut 31, 2017_.

1. Safari
2. Chrome
3. Android Webview
4. Firefox
5. Internet Explorer (11+)
6. Edge

Unless otherwise specified, the version is the current release.
