# Documentation

A guide for documenting engineering guides, workflows, standards, and styles.

## Where to Document

By default, start with [this desiringgod/guides](https://github.com/desiringgod/guides) repository and much of what you need to document will fit here.

If what you are documenting contains confidential information, it should be documented elsewhere, and you can ask the team or open an issue or pull request in a related private repository.

### Documenting in Other Repos

If what you are documenting is not related to a [Product Engineering Team](https://github.com/orgs/desiringgod/teams/engineers/members) guide, workflow, standard, or style, it should likely be documented elsewhere, typically within another repository within the [desiringGod organization](https://github.com/desiringgod).
