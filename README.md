Guides
======

Guides for getting things done, programming well, and programming in style.

* [Best Practices](/best-practices)
* [Code Review](/code-review)
* [Style](/style)
* [Workflow](/workflow)

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" and other action verbs indicate positive instruction.


Contributing

If you disagree with a guideline, open an issue on the guides repo rather than
debating it. In the meantime, apply the guideline.

A well written guide helps provide direction for the long haul, without becoming a deterrent or a roadblock. Using
generic language keeps it from being brittle.
